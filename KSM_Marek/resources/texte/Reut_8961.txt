cocoa buffer stock accord closer delegates say 13 the international cocoa organization icco moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by friday everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation monday a consumer delegate said the atmosphere is excellent other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by monday but could be in place by around april 1 if the rules are agreed by friday a detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations delegates said the package based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates has been forged bit by bit during fortnight long meetings by icco executive director kobena erbynn and a small group of other delegates producers the european community ec and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow under the proposal the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system he would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired delegates said the manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before giving preference to icco member country exporters standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin similar to golf handicaps to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins they said the differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager the delegates said revision would be decided by a majority vote of the icco council buffer stock purchases from non icco member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock they said the purchases would be limited to 5 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 000 tonnes per week and could be bought in nearby intermediate and forward positions they added one of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible delegates said after the tin market collapse in 1985 when the international tin council buffer stock ran out of funds cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism they said earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching friday deadline when the icco meeting is due to adjourn delegates said the icco failed to agree buffer stock rules in january when the new international cocoa agreement came into force the existing buffer stock of 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs both untouchable until rules are agreed though the current semi annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules producers are keen to get the wheels of the market stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices delegates said reuter
