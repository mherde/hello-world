british sugar sowings off to slow start 13 drilling of this year s british sugar beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather conditions with only around one pct sown so far a spokesman for british sugar plc said this compares with two pct at the same stage last year three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984 there is little cause for concern with better weather forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted area of around 200 000 hectares in about 10 days seed beds look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures to rise the spokesman said if the crop can be drilled by the third week in april we will be delighted he said last year a large proportion of the crop was not drilled until may but it still turned out to be the equal second largest on record reuter
