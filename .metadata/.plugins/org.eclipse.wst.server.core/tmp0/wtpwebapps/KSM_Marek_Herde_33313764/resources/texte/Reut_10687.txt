australian sugar areas said receiving some rain 13 dry areas of the australian sugar cane belt along the queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop an australian sugar producers association spokesman said the industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas notably in the burdekin and mackay regions he said from brisbane elsewhere in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern new south wales the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month he said the spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop which is harvested from around june to december he said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture such as mackay mean they really only need about three days of the region s heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane but rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas he said it s certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls he said reuter
