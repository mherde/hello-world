china faces dilemma over sugar imports 13 china has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year traders and the official press said he kang minister of agriculture animal husbandry and fisheries said this week that china has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details one japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods it will not be easy to cut domestic demand even in a state controlled economy china may have to import he said customs figures show imports fell to 1 182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1 909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25 165 tonnes in january 1987 from 54 000 in january 1986 the official economic information newspaper last month said production in the 1986 87 crushing season september april will be 1 18 mln tonnes short of demand the paper put 1986 87 output at 4 82 mln down from 5 24 mln in 1985 86 and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes in the last two years acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen sugar mills are underutilised output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day it said the country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand it added it quoted the ministry of light industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them the paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane he could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs it said in fujian the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520 1 in 1980 cutting the mills profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217 9 it added the paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985 86 crushing season losing money china has 521 sugar mills a foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986 87 september august of up to 10 pct in guangdong which produced 45 pct of china s sugar in calendar 1985 and a smaller drop in fujian which produced 11 pct of china s sugar in calendar 1985 he said both provinces are more developed than other sugar producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities but cane acreage in guangxi and yunnan which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986 87 because cane growing is more economic there he said he put sugar stocks at 2 333 mln tonnes in september 1986 a hong kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end january now they are falling but they have not reached the critical level compelling china to import quickly he said china has options not easily available in western countries it controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly he said the hong kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986 because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which he said are likely to continue until at least end 1988 he said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state owned mills with a small amount sold raw to consumers most of the mills are old and inefficient with many of them using soviet equipment imported in the 1950s he said he said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct reuter
