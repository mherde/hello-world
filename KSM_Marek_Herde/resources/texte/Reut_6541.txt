economic spotlight japan shipbuilders recovery 13 japan s ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers industry sources told reuters the salvage measures which include a government sponsored rationalisation program are aimed at clawing back some of the market which japan the world leader has lost to south korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages they said the sources said south korea s yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than japan s due to such factors the government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before parliament this month and likely to be approved by may or june the sources said they said from september a semi government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment last friday the shipbuilders association of japan applied to the fair trade commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from april 1 the commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month the sources said a clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost cutting and streamlining program and state support should help japanese yards recover their international competitiveness they said under the cartel proposals 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10 000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes cgrt in 1987 88 this is about half of total capacity this will ease the cut throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost the sources said the industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988 89 as the transport ministry sees new orders falling to 3 1 mln cgrt in 1988 89 from 3 3 mln in 1987 88 they said the rationalisation program includes a cut of 20 000 to 30 000 of the estimated 100 000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 japanese yards topped world order books at end december followed by south korea and taiwan according to lloyd s register of shipping however falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry the sources said four of japan s six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to march 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986 7 they said the shipbuilding companies streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with south korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years the sources said in japan no single yard leads the industry resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity the two largest firms mitsubishi heavy industries ltd lt mith t and ishikawajima harima heavy industries co ltd lt jima t account for only 30 pct of ships built the sources said world shipowners hope japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world said an official at a major japanese shipping company the japanese merchant fleet the largest after liberia s has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships and this will encourage japanese yards the sources said reuter
