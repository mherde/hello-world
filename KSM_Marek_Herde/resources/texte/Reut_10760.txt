cocoa deal seen positive but no price guarantee 13 the buffer stock rules agreement reached on friday by the international cocoa organization icco is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices many icco delegates and trade sources said the accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 member icco council after two weeks of talks european chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long if the buffer stock operation is successful i doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices a european dealer said and if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically dealers said the buffer stock is the market regulating tool of the icco into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre set stabilization range a new cocoa agreement came into force in january but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time the new rules take effect immediately the buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market since prices are below the must buy level of 1 600 special drawing rights per tonne specified in the agreement the sources said the buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 000 tonnes within a five week period but its approach will be more cautious buffer stock manager juergen plambeck said the buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 000 tonnes of cocoa 100 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock icco council chairman and ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices ivory coast is the world s largest cocoa producer we have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market bra kanon told reporters after the council adjourned bra kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 000 tonnes estimated by the icco statistics committee however some producer and consumer members emerged from the final icco council meeting with reservations about the pact ghana whose high quality cocoa is the world s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country s export earnings made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa saying they were too high for ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock according to consumer spokesman peter baron of west germany consumers weren t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules we reached a very sensitive compromise there were no real winners or losers some european community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks and as a result doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have delegates said under the new rules the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas using price differentials to reflect different qualities non icco member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock london cocoa prices traded today around 1 300 stg per tonne down from around 1 450 stg in january 1987 and 1 750 stg in january 1986 a cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it according to the agreement the withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 600 sdr lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled or if the buffer stock runs low on funds it says the icco will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on june 9 12 icco officials said reuter
